            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <span class="companyName">GoodHope Research Solutions</span> cares about your privacy and security. For this reason, we collect and use personal information only as and when needed to deliver our products, services, websites and mobile applications, and to communicate with you about the same, or as you have requested (henceforth collectively referred to as our "Services"). Your personal information includes information such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Name</li>
                <li>Address</li>
                <li>Telephone / Cellphone number</li>
                <li>Email address</li>
                <li>Billing and payment information</li>
                <li>Candidate information (for job applicants)</li>
                <li>Other data collected that could directly or indirectly identify you</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our Privacy Policy not only explains how and why we use your personal information that we collect, but also how you can access, update or otherwise take control of your personal information. You can get in touch with our Support Team for your most common questions, quick links to access your Account Settings, instructions on how to exercise certain rights that might be available to you, and definitions to key terms and concepts noted in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>If at any time you have questions about our practices or any of your rights described below, you may reach our Support Team by contacting us at support@goodhope.org.in. This inbox is actively monitored and managed so that we can deliver an experience that you can confidently trust.</p>

            <hr />

            <p><b>What information do we collect, how we collect it, and why</b></p>
            Much of what you likely consider personal information is collected directly from you:
            <ul>
                <li>when you create an account or purchase any of our Services (eg: billing information, including name, address, credit card number, government identification, etc.);</li>
                <li>when you request assistance from our customer support team (eg: phone number, email address, etc.);</li>
                <li>when you complete contact forms or request information from us (eg: email); or</li>
                <li>when you participate in contests and research surveys, apply for a job, or otherwise participate in activities we promote that might require information about you.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, we also collect additional information when delivering our Services to you to ensure necessary and optimal performance. These methods of collection may not be as obvious to you, so we thought we should highlight and explain a bit more about what these might be (as they vary from time to time).</p>
            <p><b>Cookies and similar technologies</b> on our websites and mobile applications allow us to track your browsing behaviour, such as links clicked, pages viewed, and services purchased. Specifically, the data collected relates to your interactions with our site features or third party features, such as social media plugins, contained within the Services; Internet Protocol (IP) address (for example, to determine your language/location preference; browser type and settings; the date and time our Services were used; device type and settings; operating system used; application IDs, unique device identifiers; and error data). We also automatically collect data to measure website performance and improve our systems, including metadata, log files, page load time, server response time to optimize DNS resolution, network routing and server configurations. For additional information, please visit our Cookie Policy.</p>
            <p><b>Supplemental data</b> may be received about you from other sources.  For example, from publicly available databases, social media platforms, or third parties from whom we have purchased data.  In which case we may combine this data with information we already have about you so that we can update, expand and analyze the accuracy of our records, assess the qualifications of a candidate for employment, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you. If you provide us with personal information about others, or if others give us your information, you can be rest assured that we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.</p>

            <hr />

            <p><b>How we utilize information</b></p>
            We strongly believe in both minimizing the data we collect and limiting its use and purpose to only:
            <ol>
                <li>for which we have been given permission,</li>
                <li>as found necessary to deliver the Services you purchase or interact with, or </li>
                <li>as we find required or permitted for legal compliance or other lawful purposes.</li>
            </ol>

            <hr />

            <p><b>Delivering, improving, updating and enhancing our Services</b></p>
            We collect various information relating to your purchase, use and/or interactions with our Services. We utilize this information to:
            <ol>
                <li>Improve and optimize the operation and performance of our Services (including our websites and mobile applications)</li>
                <li>Diagnose problems with and identify any security and compliance risks, errors, or needed enhancements to the Services.</li>
                <li>Detect and prevent fraud and abuse of our Services and systems.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Much of the data collected is aggregated for statistical purposes about how our Services are used, and is not linked to any personal information.</p>

            <hr />

            <p><b>Sharing with trusted third parties</b></p>
            We may share your personal information with affiliated companies within our corporate family, with third parties with which we have partnered to allow you to integrate their services into our own Services, and with trusted third party service providers as necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Processing credit card payments</li>
                <li>Conducting contests or surveys</li>
                <li>Performing analysis of our Services, customer demographics, and sentiment analysis</li>
                <li>Communicating with you, such as by way of email or survey delivery</li>
                <li>Customer relationship management</li>
                <li>Security, risk management and compliance</li>
                <li>Serving advertisements</li>
                <li>Recruiting support and related services</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These third parties (and any subcontractors they may be permitted to use) have agreed not to share, use or retain your personal information for any purpose other than as necessary for the provision of Services.</p>
            We will also disclose your information to third parties:
            <ul>
                <li>in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets (whether as a result of liquidation, bankruptcy or otherwise), in which case we will disclose your data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets; or</li>
                <li>if we sell, buy, merge, are acquired by, or partner with other companies or businesses, or sell some or all of our assets. In such transactions, your information may be among the transferred assets.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr />
            <p><b>Communicating with you</b></p>
            We may contact you directly or through a third party service provider regarding products or services you have signed up or purchased from us, such as necessary to deliver transactional or service related communications. We may also contact you with offers for additional services we think you will find valuable if you give us consent, or where allowed to contact you based on legitimate interests. You don''t need to provide consent as a condition to purchase our goods or services. These contacts may include:
            <ul>
                <li>Email</li>
                <li>Text (SMS) messages</li>
                <li>Phone calls</li>
                <li>Messenger applications (e.g. WhatsApp, etc.)</li>
                <li>Automated phone calls or text messages</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If we collect information from you in connection with a co-branded offer, it will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the information and whose privacy policy applies. In addition, it will describe any options you have regarding the use and/or sharing of your personal information with a co-branded partner, as well as how to exercise those options. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of third party sites. Please read the privacy policy of any website you visit.</p>
            <p>If you make use of a service that allows you to import contacts (ex. using email marketing services to send emails on your behalf), we will only use the contacts and any other personal information for the requested service. If you believe that anyone has provided us with your personal information and you would like to request that it be removed from our database, please contact us at support@goodhope.org.in.</p>

            <hr />

            <p><b>Transfer of personal information abroad</b></p>
            <p>If you utilize our Services from a country other than the country where our servers are located, your personal information may be transferred across international borders, which will only be done when necessary for the performance of our contract with you, when we have your consent to do so, or subject to the appropriate standard contractual clauses.</p>

            <hr />

            <p><b>Compliance with legal, regulatory and law enforcement requests</b></p>
            <p>We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process, to protect our property and rights or the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.</p>
            <p>To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we may take reasonable steps to notify you if we are required to provide your personal information to third parties as part of legal process. We will also share your information to the extent necessary to comply with regulations and policies when you use our Services.</p>

            <hr />

            <p><b>How we secure, store and retain your data</b></p>
            <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to store and protect the personal information we collect, both during transmission and once received and stored, including utilization of encryption where appropriate. We retain personal information for as long as required to engage in the uses described in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required by applicable law.</p>
            The criteria used to determine our retention periods include the following:
            <ul>
                <li>The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide Services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using our Services);</li>
                <li>Whether account owners modify or their users delete information through their accounts;</li>
                <li>Whether we have a legal obligation to keep the data (for example, certain laws require us to maintain records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or</li>
                <li>Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to the enforcement of our agreements, the resolution of disputes, and applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigation).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you make a request to delete your personal information and that data is necessary for the products or services you have purchased from/through us, the request will be honored only to the extent it is no longer necessary for any Services purchased or required for our legitimate business purposes or legal or contractual record keeping requirements.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions about the security or retention of your personal information, you can contact us at support@goodhope.org.in.</p>

            <hr />

            <p><b>"Do Not Track" notifications</b></p>
            <p>Some browsers allow you to automatically notify websites you visit not to track you using a "Do Not Track" signal. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. Like many websites and online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor's browser. To find out more about "Do Not Track" you may visit <a href="www.allaboutdnt.com" target="_blank">www.allaboutdnt.com</a> for more information.</p>

            <hr />

Our Services are not targeted to, intended to be consumed by, or designed to entice individuals under the age of 18.

            <hr />
            <p><b>Non-Discrimination</b></p>
            We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights. Unless permitted under applicable laws, we will not:

            </ul>

            <hr />

            <p><b>Changes to this policy</b></p>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy and any other places we deem appropriate, so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page, at least thirty (30) days prior to the implementation of the changes.</p>
